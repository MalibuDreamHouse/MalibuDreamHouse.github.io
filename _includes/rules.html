                      Ask people that have been at the house before or anyone else that's around. It sucks to throw a party and answer literally 200 questions in a day.
                      Instead invite them to a conversation, or bring them a treat

                      This one's for the men. If you just need to pee, go in the bushes
                      helps to scare away the deer and reduces the need to deal with the compost toilets.

                      Just remember to <strong>TAKE IT HOME</strong>
                      the Malibu Dream House does not need 20 permanent coolers, or 60 Hummus containers.
