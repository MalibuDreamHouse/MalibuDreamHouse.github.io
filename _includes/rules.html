                      "Cleaning as we go" is very central to our culture here. This means everyone! Here's a partial list of things to do during the party: Take out the trash. Straighten up the food table. Throw away empty bottles from the bar. Wipe up spills. Gather & wash used cups.

                      The outdoor area near the jacuzzi is now an "almost fully functional" kitchen. When you arrive, take your drinks, food & coolers directly to this area NOT the indoor kitchen. Grill/eat/drink/wash dishes all in one area. More details here:

If anyone has a concern about a guest based on behavior at other events, please advise your hosts proactively.

                      Towels & robes are available for your use. Ask a regular if you can't find them. Save water! Towel Fairies are volunteers (like you!) who put damp towels in the dryer, fold & return them. Otherwise, they'll be wet and smelly the next day, requiring many loads of laundry. You may hang your towel on a hook if you'll soak again later.

                      We say this constantly, but at every party, someone puts their drink, keys, other items on one of our drums, our fish tank or a piece of art. <strong>PLEASE</strong> respect our nice things and the nice people who share them with you.
