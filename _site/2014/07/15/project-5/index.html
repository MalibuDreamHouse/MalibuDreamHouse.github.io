                      Ask people that have been at the house before or anyone else that's around. It sucks to throw a party and answer literally 200 questions in a day.

                    <p class="text-muted">
                      This is a rule upgrade from "No Glass by the Pool". Glass anywhere at a big party is an opportunity for disaster.  The only glass allowed on premise is inside the fridge, on the outdoor bar or in the trash.  Pour beer, champagne, wine, etc. directly into a sealed non-glass container (such as a travel mug or sippy cup). We are transitioning out of "open cups" to reduce spills.  Bring Your Own!  Saves waste.

                      Our septic can't keep up with a large crowd, so indoor restrooms are off limits.

                      Men: Rather than fill up our compost toilets quickly, you are welcome to go pee in the bushes or the fence/property line so long as it's not a "public show". Urine helps to scare away the deer & coyotes, so you're helping keep our chickens and vegetables safe from predators.

                      Our events are not catered. Bring food, drinks, ice, coolers, your own serving bowl, etc.  Potluck style is encouraged, but you are not required to share, especially if you are on a budget or have special dietary needs (or brought fancy champagne!).  Generally speaking, our crowd likes protein and "real food" as opposed to crackers and cookies. Home cooked food is not necessary. Vintage Grocers has an excellent deli, located just a few miles south on PCH and Trancas. Label All Your Things! <strong>TAKE IT HOME</strong> when the party is over.

                      The outdoor area near the jacuzzi is now an "almost fully functional" kitchen with room for drinks, fridge, food table, sink with running water, gas grill, dishes, silverware and tools.  When you arrive, take your drinks & snacks directly to this area. Do NOT store anything in the indoor fridge or use our stove or oven without permission (which may be granted, but is generally discouraged until breakfast).

                    <p class="text-muted">
                      Clean as you go. Clean up after others. At a minimum, throw your stuff away instead of leaving cups or plates in random spots.  Take out the trash when it's full.  Clear the food table. Toss the empty bottles so the bar stays functional.   If every guest spent an extra 5 or 10 minutes doing this, the party would be mostly cleared at the end.  Thank you Awesome Helpers who do all the heavy lifting at the end of a party.  You are angels.

                      Towels are available for your use under the futon by the jacuzzi, and robes are located in the closet in the Hat Room. Save water!  Towel Fairies are volunteers who run damp towels through the dryer, fold them and put them back while the party is ongoing. Otherwise, they'll be wet and smelly the next day, requiring many loads of laundry, wasting water and time.  You may hang your towel on a hook if you are planning to soak again. If you see a large volume of abandoned towels hanging on the futon, this is YOUR opportunity to be a Towel Fairy.

                      ZTFA is our old school term "Zero Tolerance for A--holes".  During an event, this means: leave your drama at the door, don't get out of control or break any of the Harsh Rules. If there's an issue, that person would be asked to leave and not welcomed back.  Also, since everyone here is part of a community we've chosen, ZTFA also applies beyond just the scope of our events.  If there's a concern about any particular individual and you have FACTS to share, please inform us so we can handle it in an appropriate manner.  Merely disliking someone is not grounds for ZTFA.

                            <p>Unless you are specifically invited or directed to park here, this driveway is off limits. Motorcycles may park up at the very top of this driveway near the outhouse. If you're coming in an RV, you will likely be directed here, but if you're coming in an RV you've already worked that out with the Pennys and don't need this page to tell you that. <br /><br /> "But I'm only dropping off/unloading my shit"... Yes, and you will likley be fine to do so. Checking in first is better than assuming, so we can avoid problems or gridlock. In general if you are a DJ or otherwise bringing party-related equipment, unloading up by the garage is fine. If you just brought a lot of stuff for camping, this isn't the place to unload it. Better to ask the Czar than have Mr. Penny come out to have a word with you... <br /><br /> IF you do indeed park on the driveway, please park on the ocean side as far over as you can, facing the exit. There MUST be room for cars to get by you easily.</p>

                            <p>Once you drive up from Lot A to Lot B, you will note unpaved areas to the left of you. As you turn past Lot B to the right along the gazebo, you will see open unpaved space up along your left (top of property, to the north) and in front of you. Past the gazebo everything opens up, and the entire eastern half of the property is available in general.<br /> <br />For large events with camping, keep this in mind Staying longer means park deeper in, let others park behind you. Not sleeping in your car? Good, take a sloped area to park. Sleeping in your car? Take an unpaved flat area before a paved one. See areas marked with orange bricks for tenting? DO NOT PARK THERE. Every event is different, parking vs. tenting areas may shift around from event to event. Tenters, there is an area on the far south and east side of the property that isn't exactly level, but is good for tents and cars aren't going to park there (on map, the violet area, the old Midden area).</p>

                            <p>After you take the fork up to the back, the first area you come to is known as Parking Lot A (because I just made that up). This area includes the paved area by the kitchen entrance and Turdis, the adjacent flat unpaved area, some rugged spot off the driveway up (on map as A15 and A16, 4x4 recommended), plus an extra side space for a small car. The main paved area is meant to go 2 cars deep; if you are the first in, pull all the way up and slightly over the edge of the blacktop to allow a second car behind you. The spaces are clearly painted. The unpaved area is open for tents during camping events. Otherwise cars may park there, this space should be able to handle two cars side by side. There is a small space in the corner (on map as A14 here) where a compact car can fit if necessary (Mini, SmartCar, or teenie Fiat only, please). <br /> <br /> IF YOU DO PARK HERE pull as far to the side as you can, stay parallel with the road, and use your parking brake!</p>

                            <p>Past the first paved lot is a slope that will take you to Parking Lot B (upper paved area, next to the black astroturf). This is meant to be parked in 2 cars deep. You'll note the small white fencing at the edge of the blacktop, it means DO NOT PARK ON THE ASTROTURF. Pretty self explanatory, but reminders are surprisingly needed.<br /> <br /> NOTE This *used* to be for car-camping... aaaand it still is, BUT (of course there's a "but") only if the non-paved flat areas are full. Ideally, paved spots are for people not staying long or in need of easy access (handicap, injuries, etc).<br /> <br />Note the unpaved driveway coming up from the lower lot and turning right along the upper lot and turf... THIS IS A DRIVEWAY, NOT A PARKING AREA! There are also signs on the property calling this out. DO NOT PARK IN THE DRIVEWAY, EVER. NOT EVEN FOR "QUICK UNLOADING"...</p>
