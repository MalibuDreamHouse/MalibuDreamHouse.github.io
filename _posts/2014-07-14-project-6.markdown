description: Once you drive up from Lot A to Lot B, you will note unpaved areas to the left of you. As you turn past Lot B to the right along the gazebo, you will see open unpaved space up along your left (top of property, to the north) and in front of you. Past the gazebo everything opens up, and the entire eastern half of the property is available in general.<br /> <br />For large events with camping, keep this in mind Staying longer means park deeper in, let others park behind you. Not sleeping in your car? Good, take a sloped area to park. Sleeping in your car? Take an unpaved flat area before a paved one. See areas marked with orange bricks for tenting? DO NOT PARK THERE. Every event is different, parking vs. tenting areas may shift around from event to event. Tenters, there is an area on the far south and east side of the property that isn't exactly level, but is good for tents and cars aren't going to park there (on map, the violet area, the old Midden area).
