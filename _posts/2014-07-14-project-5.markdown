description: Past the first paved lot is a slope that will take you to Parking Lot B (upper paved area, next to the black astroturf). This is meant to be parked in 2 cars deep. You'll note the small white fencing at the edge of the blacktop, it means DO NOT PARK ON THE ASTROTURF. Pretty self explanatory, but reminders are surprisingly needed.<br /> <br /> NOTE This *used* to be for car-camping... aaaand it still is, BUT (of course there's a "but") only if the non-paved flat areas are full. Ideally, paved spots are for people not staying long or in need of easy access (handicap, injuries, etc).<br /> <br />Note the unpaved driveway coming up from the lower lot and turning right along the upper lot and turf... THIS IS A DRIVEWAY, NOT A PARKING AREA! There are also signs on the property calling this out. DO NOT PARK IN THE DRIVEWAY, EVER. NOT EVEN FOR "QUICK UNLOADING"...
